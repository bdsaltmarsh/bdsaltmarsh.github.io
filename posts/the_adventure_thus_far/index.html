  Previous Recap
  <a class="anchor" href="#previous-recap">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The crew is taking a long rest in town after completing their 
  <a href="/docs/quests/#document-retreaval">Document Retreaval</a> quest.</p>

<p>The Salty Turtle Crew (STC) contacted Ingo the drover for the payment from their Document Retreaval mission.  Ingo paid them 9800gp (total of 10,000) as promised from Aubreck.  After picking up the gold, they went back to the boat for a gourmet breakfast from Kholos.  After that, the group discussed and decided to go around town and find out what gossip and rumors.</p>
<p>The STC went to the Snapping Line to talk to the locals.  When they arrived, they were the only ones there as it was still morning.  The group spoke with Hanna and she was able to provide them with some history and gossip from Saltmarsh.</p>
<h3 id="hannas-gossip">
  Hanna&rsquo;s Gossip:
  <a class="anchor" href="#hannas-gossip">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Spurned on by Elron &ndash; Hanna started to discuss the locals feelings on the changing in town, the kings men, rumors and tragedy.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-town-becoming-larger-and-more-influenced-by-the-king">
  On the town becoming larger and more influenced by the king:
  <a class="anchor" href="#on-the-town-becoming-larger-and-more-influenced-by-the-king">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seems to be a split in town.  Saltmarsh had a long history of being a fishing villege and some are concerned that it&rsquo;ll go away.</li>
<li>The kings influence in town has been mostly minimal and seems to be causing some good changes.
<ul>
<li>The town seems to genuinely like Eliander.
<ul>
<li>Hanna attributes this to him being a fighter of note during the King&rsquo;s war with the Trade Princes when they were attempting to control Saltmarsh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The town is less thrilled about Manistrat Copperlocks.
<ul>
<li>She was appointed onto the council, which irritated Eta.</li>
<li>Was given the mines to work by the King.</li>
<li>Her direct dwarven personality comes off as combative with the town.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall &ndash; Hanna believes there&rsquo;s no going back to the way Saltmrash was before.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tragedy">
  Tragedy:
  <a class="anchor" href="#tragedy">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hanna told the crew about Anders&rsquo; situation.</li>
<li>Anders&rsquo; mother was murdered in her estates.
<ul>
<li>Knife wound to the neck and with poison.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hanna doesn&rsquo;t know of why anyone would want to attack the family.  No major rivals or reason.
<ul>
<li>Only thing she thought of was that with her gone, perhaps Anders could be more easily controlled.</li>
<li>Thinks it&rsquo;s backfired, as Anders has stepped up on the council and has grown into having to run the family&rsquo;s business and estate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anders&rsquo; father had died in the past due to a fever.</li>
<li>Zero leads as to who dun it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rumors">
  Rumors:
  <a class="anchor" href="#rumors">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Glen Primewater (the old man on the council)
<ul>
<li>Some rumors have said that he&rsquo;s secretly working with the Sea Princes to increase their influence in Saltmarsh.</li>
<li>But he seems so nice and pleasent mannered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He Who Must Not Be Named
<ul>
<li>Hanna is not fond of of the Wizard in the tower (Kelek)</li>
<li>Thinks the town would be better off without him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>East part of town people are disappearing.
<ul>
<li>Rumors of undead.</li>
<li>Kholos was smitten with the idea of looking into this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Standing Stones
<ul>
<li>The Runestones are clearly visable coming into port.</li>
<li>Rumor that there is a spirit trapped in the Standing STones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The group finished up their drinks and decided to purchase lunch from Hanna to go have a picnic lunch at Standing Stones.</p>
<h3 id="the-standing-stones">
  The Standing Stones
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-standing-stones">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The group headed over to the Standing stones, with a brief pitstop at the Faithful Quartermaster&rsquo;s of Iuz.  Telinax purchased a bag of holding for gold he is handling as well as put in an order for any magical item which would help him swim under water.  After that, the group proceeded to the standing stones.  Telinax studied them and found that the runes were not as expected.  They were much older.  [Kevin &ndash; can you add details here, I was pulled away on baby issues].  The group poked around and tried to figure out what was going on with the standing stones, but there was nothing definitive they were able to figure out.</p>
<h3 id="the-bite">
  The Bite
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-bite">#</a>
</h3>
<p>After returning from the Island, Kholos was dead set on going over to where everyone has been warned to leave alone and investigate it.  Telinax was intensly wary of proceeding there, however the group voted for doing so.  Upon arriving, there were a ton of crabs in the area of four ruined houses.  The group started to investigate however Telinax was able to direct them to focus their efforts on a house that appeared to be in slightly better condition.  The group entered the house, proceeded to the root cellar and looked around.  Telinax and Kholos found a secret door which Kholos then kicked in.</p>
<p>On the other side of the door was a pale man who had been waiting for them.  He was well spoken and started up a conversation with Kholos.  Telinax was worried about what this person was and started to make his way back to the stairs.  The creature attempting to alter Kholos&rsquo; thoughts and Kholos immediately acted with violence.  The creature grappled and attacked Kholos, biting him and significantly hurting Kholos.  Telinax attemtped to reason with the creature, which they determined was a Vampire.</p>
