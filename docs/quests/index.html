<p>Ingo left note for the crew that he had a potential job.  Client (Aubreck) was a wealthy person once upon a time until he lost all of his papers in a storm.  A retainer had recently found the wrecked ship that had his papers in it.  Aubreck insisted on secrecy, so the group was put on his ship and confined to quarters.  3 day&rsquo;s journey later, the crew arrived at the wreck.  After boarding the boat, they encounter some large spiders.  After killing those, they went down a ladder and found a box that had a heavy chest inside of it.  At that time, a giant octopus attacked that boat.  It was a race to get out.  Kholos, Brian, Varanus and Elron were able to succeed in getting up the ladder.  Telinax and Del were not so lucky.  Del swam out in merfolk form and Telinax finally was able to get up the ladder, only to blast his way out of the hull and swim away.  As everyone was attempting to escape, another humanoid ran up and jumped off the boat.  We also noticed a large group of spiders fighting some sort of demon things as we got away.</p>

<p>Manistrat Copperlocks asked the crew to investigate some strange dwarven statues that her mining company disovered underground.  The area had been previously caved in on purpose and the way was locked.</p>
<p>The crew proceeded into the caverns, roughly 5 miles underground.  In looking at the caverns, Brian determined that this was created specifically to be able to be flooded.  The crew encountered a few undead creatures and those were dealt with easily.  The group encountered a doorway and Telinax, reckless with zeal, opened it up and was promptly fireballed along with everyone else.  After an intense fight with a Flaming Skull, the group was victorious.  They decided to take a rest.  Upon coming back, the skull was there again.  It was defeated yet again, however the crew had no idea how to permantently handle it.</p>
<p>As the group proceeded, they encountered a few swarms of undead monsters and a few larger undead minions.  After those were killed, they proceeded to an alter room.  Here a faded set of robes became some sort of undead demon and attacked the group.  Telinax bore the brunt of the psychic attack and was towned shortly there after.  The crew was able to kill the demon.  After investigating further,  they disovered a secret room, which had a diary, a spellbook, and 140pp, 1900gp, 9000sp, 900 cp and 15 amber gemstones.  They took this.</p>
<p>On the way out, the Flaming Skull was back again.  The group dispatched it again, however they still were uncertain as to how to defeat it.  They went back and reported to Manistrat Copperlocks their findings.</p>

<p>Jilar Crankleston wanted wood from a branch that had been used to hang a man.  This was a special job she was doing for a customer.  The crew went out to the north of Saltmarsh and into the marshes to see if they could find some dead man&rsquo;s wood.</p>
<p>The crew encountered a Bollywog village.  Some of the Bollywog&rsquo;s attempted to fight, others attempted to flee, and other cowered.  Most were killed.  In searching through the village, the crew found a Quiver of Elona, some gold, and a flying broom.  After questioning one of the Bollywogs, they found that a tree that had a mysterious red dirty under it was used to hanging people and then eating people.  The crew cut down the limb and returned it to Jilar.</p>

<p>Skeezix confided in Kholos about his dark past.  Kholos painted Skeezix in a rosier light and the crew decided to sail south to an Island from the Trade Princes and see what they could find out about the Platinum Chain.</p>
<p>The Platinum Chain is a slaver company which has encountered some hard times.  That being said, when the group arrived and asked some questions about them, the locals informed the chain members.  Upon meeting with the Platinum Chain members, it was made clear that they knew we were asking about them and they wanted us to leave them alone.</p>
<p>The crew attempted to get more information, however they were now being tailed by people.  Given that they were in a foreign port with no idea of what the rules were, they made a beeline to get out of the Harbor and went back to Saltmarsh.</p>
<p>Skeezix was disappointed in the outcome and went to try to find where he could drink himself into the grave further.</p>

<p>After the Town Council discussed Oceanus&rsquo; quest, they decided it would be best for us to to investigate this Lizardfolk settlement where the weapons and armor the smugglers were selling was going to go to.  The crew to the <em>Salty Turtle</em> to the west and were able to find a cove to drop anchor in.</p>
<p>A plan was determined.  Varanus and Telinax (in Lizardform via Disguise Self) would go poke around and see if they could get into the learn some intel about these Lizardfolk.  The remainder of the group would stay follow behind after the area had been scouted.</p>
<p>Upon entering the the cave complex, Varanus and Telinax were attacked by some guard lizards.  One was killed.  The rest of the group arrived just as a Lizardfolk patrol reached the group.  After some brief discussions, the ground was disarmed and brought infront of Queen Authokent.  The group was given an ultimatum &ndash; prove that they were friends to the Lizardfolk by earning their trust and they would be free to leave.</p>
<p>The group then spent the day meeting the people and finding out their stories.  This particular settlement had been attacked by some underwater demon types and had killed a good portion of their fighting power.  The group spent time helping out: fixing things, preparing meals and talking with the group.  A particular Lizardfolk, by the name of Soriv, was very pro outsiders coming in.  The shaman&rsquo;s on the other hand, were not.</p>
<p>The next day, the Queen decided that the group would be permitted to leave, letting them know that she understood that they weren&rsquo;t hear for the reasons they said they were (she told them in common, which we had spoken in infront of her assuming she couldn&rsquo;t understand.)  The group promised to go back to the Saltmarsh Council and ask for a formal relationship to be built between the two groups.</p>
<p>The crew sailed back to Saltmarsh and informed the council.  The council was going to send someone to meet with Queen Authokent (I do not recall who it was; maybe Eliander?)</p>

<p>The town council asked the crew to take care of the smuggler threat, given that a smuggler&rsquo;s ship was expected in the next few days.  They overed the crew 500 gold for completing this task.  Any stolen goods on the ship would be returned to their rightful owners and the ship, if it survived, would go to the crew.</p>
<p>Using the information from the letters they found in the smuggler&rsquo;s cove, they waited and Brian signaled the smuggling ship that there was goods ready to come out.  The crew took the smallboat out with several barrels of whiskey.  They were pulled up to the top of the boat.  From there, things got out of hand pretty quick.  The two deckhands who saw this were killed.  The crew thought they were safe until a sailor in the crows nest called the alarm.</p>
<p>A general battle started, with the Captain quickly being slain.  There was a wizard type on the boat, but the crew was able to were able to take them out.  A quick decision allowed for one of the doors to be locked to prevent the smuggler crew from below getting up.  The rest of the smuggler crews came up through the aft lower cabin doors, however they were stuck in the steps by Kholos and Del.  As the fight raged on, the superior positioning allowed for all of the smuggler crew to be slain.</p>
<p>As the crew continued to clear out rooms, they encountered three Lizardfolk.  Varanus attempted to talk with them, however words failed and a fight ensued.  The Lizardfolk were quickly overrun, however Telinax fell in the fight and had to be revived by his friends.</p>
<p>The crew waited out the rest of the night and took the boat, corpses and all, back to Saltmarsh to report their victory.</p>

  Part I:
  <a class="anchor" href="#part-i">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Upon resting at the Marinier&rsquo;s Guild Hall &ndash; a crazy person named Skeezix burst in yelling about ghosts and hauntings at the haunted mansion outside of town.  He wanted someone to go in and confirm that it was haunted, as people didn&rsquo;t believe him.  With Kholos praying and nothing else better to do, the crew decided to take him up on his offer.</p>
<p>It was rough going at first.  Upon entering the grounds, the crew was set upon by giant badgers.  They were able to fight them off, however were quite tired in doing so.  While looking at the well, they saw the glimmer of coins in the bottom of it.  Brian proceeded down, only to be attacked by snakes.  After much combat and a few revivals, the snakes were defeated and the 9 copper was obtained from the bottom of the well.</p>
<p>The crew then took a long rest, and then proceeded to investigate into the house further.  As they cleared out through the rooms, the group took some damage from random spiders and exploding cabinets.  Having cleared out a good portion of the upstairs, they went back to town to rest and then return.</p>
<p>The crew returned to investigate the lower level.  In doing so, they found some plate armor that was covered in slime.  Upon getting closer to the plate armor, three rot grubs attacked Varanus.  After much fighting and exprimenting, where Varanus was exceptionally close to dying multiple times, it was disovered that rot grubs are sensitive to fire.  The crew was exhausted from this effort, so they took the plate armor upstairs into the kitchen area and rested.</p>
<p>As their rest ended, they heard noises from someone coming upstairs.  As the door opened, the person (smuggler) fired at one of the party members.  He was then compelled to surrender and tell us why he was shooting at us.  Discussions ensued and they ended up taking the person downstairs through a secret door.  The man called out that &lsquo;they have company&rsquo; and a new fight started.  Del, fresh in the new armor, was nearly incinerated by a mage&rsquo;s Scorching Ray.  Another person fell to a critical hit.  Finally, we were able to persuade the captors to stabilize our friends.</p>
<h4 id="part-ii">
  Part II:
  <a class="anchor" href="#part-ii">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Kholos, concerned that his friends had not come back from the haunted house, convinced the local town guard to come with him to look for his friends.  The guard came into the hideout section of the haunted house and arrested everyone but Kholos&rsquo; friends.</p>
<p>After resting up, the group found a hidden door in the lower level that lead to a series of caves.  As they moved through the caves, they alerted a band of smugglers and there was an attack, where Brian was dropped.  After doing some back and forth, the crew decided to make a run for it back up to the lower level room where this secret door was located.  They were chased by the smugglers and a bottleneck fight occurred.  The smugglers were killed in the fight and the crew managed to all stay alive.</p>
<p>The crew then explored the cave and found a large cache of goods hidden in the cave as well as a small boat.  They decided to pick up the goods and bring them back to the town, as they thought these might be stolen goods.</p>
<p>Prior to going back to town, the group went through a door labeled with <strong>&lsquo;DANGER:  UNDEAD&rsquo;</strong>.  Here they discovered some sort of lab of a late wizard.  Upon entering the lab, there were in fact undead minions of some type that attempted to prevent the party from entering.  They minions were dealt with promptly and the crew scavenged all sorts of items and books from the lab prior to going back into town.</p>
<p>After meeting with the town council, the council members gave them 200gp for returning the stolen goods and asked them to handle the smuggling threat, offering them 500gp to do so.</p>
